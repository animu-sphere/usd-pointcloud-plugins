# Implementation Status

## 2026-08-01

- [x] Add root CMake to the empty repository
- [x] Add the minimal `usd-geo-core` library structure
- [x] Add `SpatialBounds` validation, expansion, center, and size operations
- [x] Add the `GeoReference` contract for CRS, units, up axis, and origin
- [x] Add core unit tests
- [x] Add OpenStrata workspace and `usdGeoCore` library manifests
- [x] Generate and validate the OpenStrata runtime lockfile
- [x] Build and test the core through `ost`
- [x] Define library ownership and dependency direction
- [x] Define the file-format support order and entry gates
- [x] Add finite-value validation and explicit local-coordinate transforms
- [x] Add deterministic tile IDs and normalized cache-key inputs
- [x] Create `usdPointCloudCore` point-attribute and chunk contracts
- [x] Create `usdGeoUsd` `UsdGeomPoints` authoring and metadata round-trip
- [x] Add `usdLas` LAS 1.2-1.4 header inspection and uncompressed point decoding
- [x] OpenUSD FileFormat Plugin PoC (LAS discovery and UsdGeomPoints authoring path)
- [x] LAS reader integration and deterministic conformance fixture
- [ ] LAZ reader
- [ ] Tile / LOD
- [ ] USDC cache

## Next Implementation Sequence

1. Add LAS VLR/EVLR metadata inspection and CRS extraction.
2. Define the LAZ codec decision and begin chunked reader integration.

Do not begin LAZ integration until the LAS conformance fixture passes through both the reader-only tests and the FileFormat Plugin integration test.
