## Next Implementation Sequence

1. Define the shared tile / LOD contracts.

The shared reader API stabilizes the point schema and streaming path before
tile / LOD work begins. Its current contract is documented in
[point reader architecture](../architecture/point-reader.md).

The LAS conformance fixture and FileFormat Plugin integration gate passed
before LAZ integration. The LAZ reader now uses the same point-cloud authoring
path and validates chunked decoder output through a FileFormat Plugin
integration fixture. Documented support is tracked in
[supported formats](../supported-formats.md), which is updated in the same
change as any decoder that widens it.
