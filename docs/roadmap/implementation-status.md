## Release track status

### `v0.2.1` — implementation stabilization and conversion tooling

This patch release stabilizes the LAS and LAZ implementation released in
`v0.2.0`. It does not add a new point-cloud format.

- [x] Publish real-dataset processing-time, peak-RSS, spool, and payload output
      measurements
- [x] Measure payload working sets through the available Storm scene/view and
      headless render paths
- [x] Complete long-running, cancellation, failure, and interruption cleanup
      validation for tiled reads
- [x] Add the explicit LAS/LAZ conversion tool as the production path for
      tiled, payload-backed generation, including deterministic manifest output
- [x] Close release documentation gaps for compatibility, installation,
      licensing, and large-data operation
- [x] Add regression coverage for each stabilization fix

### `v0.3.0` — COPC read support (shipped)

COPC shipped as local, read-only support using the existing point, streaming,
tiling, diagnostics, and `usdLod` contracts.

- [x] Add the OpenUSD-independent COPC metadata and hierarchy reader foundation
      (LAS 1.4 COPC Info VLR and local hierarchy pages)
- [x] Read selected local COPC point-data byte ranges through the shared LAZ
      chunk decoder
- [x] Add a format-specific COPC reader and thin FileFormat Plugin adapter
- [x] Validate COPC information and hierarchy metadata
- [x] Read required hierarchy nodes and point-data byte ranges selectively
- [x] Map native hierarchy and resolution metadata to the shared tile/LOD model
- [x] Add the COPC pull-based point stream over native hierarchy order
- [x] Add LAS, LAZ, and COPC point-stream equivalence regression coverage
- [x] Verify LAS, LAZ, and COPC equivalence across authored LOD representations
- [x] Keep COPC writing, HTTP range sources, network caching, and new public
      USD schemas out of the local-read release

- [x] Keep faces, mesh authoring, PLY writing, and metadata-only reads out of
      scope

## Follow-up Status

### Completed: bounded-memory streaming and spatial tiling stabilization

The completed work is documented in [streaming and tiling](streaming-and-tiling.md).

- [x] `PointStream` pull interface in `usdPointCloudCore`
- [x] `usdPointCloudTiling`: fixed-grid tile keys, configuration, and source-coordinate tile router
- [x] Spool schema, thresholds, cleanup, and deterministic iteration order
- [x] Bounded-memory tests and generated large-corpus spill coverage
- [x] Generated-corpus streaming benchmark and documented measurement command
- [x] Full-size real-dataset processing-time, RSS, spool, and payload output
      measurements
- [x] Payload working-set measurements through the available Storm scene/view
      and headless render paths
- [x] Failure and interruption cleanup validation across tiled reads
- [x] Explicit conversion tool with atomic publish and deterministic manifest
      output
- [x] Versioned tile manifests with deterministic tile/LOD ordering, payload
      paths, bounds, and point counts

The stabilization slice completed a reproducible LAS/LAZ measurement matrix
using the checked-in 4,096-point thinned corpora, full-size Shizuoka LAS and
derived-LAZ measurements, and regression coverage for recovery when a
conversion transaction marker exists without its state file. Full-size
interruption recovery is validated by force-terminating the converter after
transaction state creation and retrying the same output workspace.

### Completed follow-up work

- [x] Extra Bytes descriptor-name normalization contract
- [x] Vector Extra Bytes types
- [x] Bounds and classification filter arguments for LAS and LAZ
- [x] EPSG inference and conflicting-CRS detection
- [x] Declare OST smoke fixtures in both bundle manifests and pass L3/L4
      `usdcat.read` and `python.stage_open`
- [x] Add the initial `usdGeoCache` contracts for deterministic descriptor keys,
      USDC layout, cache lookup, and entry invalidation

### Remaining open work

- [x] Complete PLY scalar vertex decoding and the thin `pointcloud-ply`
      FileFormat adapter with explicit CRS arguments

- [x] Integrate deterministic USDC cache generation and lookup into the
      conversion tool through `--cache-root`
- [x] Integrate cache lookup into direct FileFormat and authoring paths. The
      conversion tool owns generation through `--cache-root`; LAS, LAZ, COPC,
      and PLY adapters read committed entries through `USDGEO_CACHE_ROOT`.
- [x] Stage licensing, notice, capability, compatibility, and installation
      documents into release assets
- [x] Adopt narrow format-specific dynamic LOD fields after generated assets
      and cache lookup stabilized ([ADR 0003](../adr/0003-dynamic-file-format.md))
- [x] Add the project-owned random-access byte source contract and move LAS
      and local COPC reads onto it
- [x] Add resolver-backed `ArAsset` adaptation without introducing OpenUSD or
      transport dependencies into `usdCopc`

### Next release direction

- [x] Complete the v0.3.x documentation consolidation: concise root README
      and synchronized workspace, capability, and implementation documents.
- [x] Complete v0.4.0 PLY point-cloud read support with bounded source
      streaming and tiled authoring follow-up work after the shipped scalar
      direct-read and cache-lookup slice.
- [x] Complete v0.5.0 COPC random access with an OpenUSD `ArAsset` adapter,
      resolver-dependent HTTP support, and conservative generated-cache
      identity; the project-owned source interface and local migration are
      shipped. Resolver-backed cache reuse is disabled when a stable local
      filesystem identity is unavailable.

### Infrastructure maturity milestones

The ordered plan and acceptance priorities are in the
[infrastructure maturity roadmap](infrastructure-maturity.md).

#### `v0.6.0` - cache and source identity (shipped)

- [x] Define a format- and transport-independent source identity contract
-     `usdgeo::cache::SourceIdentity` accepts a stable identifier and
      validation token, with optional size and modification metadata;
      local filesystem identity construction is shared by authoring and the
      conversion tool
- [x] Define machine-readable cache lookup states for missing, incomplete,
      hit, and invalid layouts while preserving the `IsCacheHit` API
- [x] Document cache invalidation and compatibility rules in the
      `usdGeoCache` module README
- [x] Add cache statistics and stable diagnostics. `usdgeo::cache` exposes
      stable lookup status names and process-local hit, miss, incomplete, and
      invalid-layout counters through `LookupStatistics`.
- [x] Harden corrupt-entry and interrupted-publication recovery
      committed cache roots are opened and payload references are validated
      before reuse; unreadable roots and invalid or missing payloads are
      invalidated through the descriptor-derived entry path
- [x] Establish local and resolver-backed cache reuse baselines. The
      conversion integration test records the local miss-to-hit path, while
      `pointcloudCopc_integration` verifies that configuring `USDGEO_CACHE_ROOT`
      does not enable reuse for resolver assets without a stable validation
      token.

#### `v0.7.0` - adaptive tiling (shipped)

- [x] Define deterministic point-budget planning and limits
- [x] Preserve fixed-grid `tileSize` and `tileMemoryLimit` behavior
- [x] Add tile statistics and planning diagnostics
- [x] Compare LAS, LAZ, COPC, and PLY payload and memory behavior through the
      reproducible cross-format benchmark report; larger real-world datasets
      remain dataset-dependent

#### Unreleased on `main`

- [x] Publish a deterministic `tiles.manifest` beside the payload assets with
      tile ID, LOD level, source bounds, point count, and portable payload path
- [x] Invalidate cached entries whose tile manifest is incomplete

#### `v0.8.0` - measurement and I/O observability (released 2026-08-14)

- [x] Compare fixed-grid and adaptive tiling on real-world LAS, LAZ, COPC, and
      PLY inputs with uneven density
-     The final matrix completed for Shizuoka LAS/LAZ, Autzen COPC, and
      Stanford Bunny PLY with fixed-grid and adaptive rows for every format.
- [x] Add a reproducible fixed-grid versus adaptive comparison harness that
      records corpus identity, normalized settings, tile distributions, RSS,
      source and spool I/O, payload bytes, and processing time in TSV and JSON
- [x] Record points per tile distribution, payload bytes per tile, total
      payload bytes, tile count, and tree depth in the reproducible benchmark
      report for both strategies on the same fixture inputs
- [x] Record peak RSS, spool bytes, source read bytes, and total processing
      time for both strategies in benchmark output and real-world baselines
- [x] Record `usdview` startup/open elapsed time and peak process-tree working
      set for the generated output
- [x] Provide a reproducible build-local payload-backed `usdview` fixture
      recipe from the public-domain USGS 3DEP corpus
- [x] Add source bytes read, spool bytes written, spool bytes read, payload
      bytes written, and effective I/O amplification to the streaming benchmark
- [x] Publish the commands and corpus provenance needed to reproduce each
      baseline; the comparison harness records the input SHA-256 beside every
      fixed-grid and adaptive result

#### `v0.9.0` - TilePlan convergence and interactive validation (released 2026-08-15)

- [x] Measure host responsiveness while interacting with the generated output
      using the documented five-key workload and the reproducible USGS 3DEP
      4,096-point payload-backed fixture; the baseline is recorded in the
      [infrastructure maturity roadmap](infrastructure-maturity.md)
- [x] Define the `TilePlan` contract: tile identity, bounds, point counts,
      parent and child relationships, source ranges, depth, and planner
      identity and version
- [x] Adapt the existing point-budget planner output into `TilePlan` without
      changing its partitioning behavior; the shared tile router accepts the
      adapted representation
- [x] Define how cache identity derives from a tile plan, and treat planner
      algorithm changes as a versioned compatibility concern through the
      deterministic `TilePlanCacheArguments` / `StableTilePlanKey` contract
      and planner identity/version cache inputs
- [x] Map COPC native hierarchy nodes and byte ranges onto a tile plan instead
      of re-deriving the partition
- [x] Verify equivalent authored output from a sequential plan and a
      COPC-native plan describing the same partition

#### `v0.10.0` - resolver-backed source identity and external resolver interoperability (released 2026-08-23)

The contract is recorded in the
[resolver-backed source contract](../architecture/RESOLVER_SOURCE.md); the
scope and exit gate are in the
[infrastructure maturity roadmap](infrastructure-maturity.md).

Phase 1 — identity contract:

- [x] Review the existing `usdgeo::cache::SourceIdentity` model against the
      neutral `resolvedIdentifier` / `size` / `validationToken` representation
- [x] Define resolver-backed stability semantics for `Stable`, `Unstable`, and
      `Unavailable` identity, and what each level permits
- [x] Add opaque validation-identity support without transport-specific field
      names entering the cache contract
- [x] Keep serialization and stable cache keys deterministic, and add unit
      tests

Phase 2 — resolver adapter:

- [x] Centralize `ArResolver` / `ArAsset` identity extraction in one adapter
      owned by `usdGeoCache` or an adjacent resolver integration layer
- [x] Keep the adapter outside LAS, LAZ, COPC, and PLY readers
- [x] Add stable, unstable, and unavailable identity test assets
- [x] Preserve current resolver-backed COPC read behavior

Phase 3 — generated cache reuse:

- [x] Enable generated-cache lookup for stable resolver identities, with
      `TilePlan` identity and version remaining compatibility inputs
- [x] Retain conservative no-reuse behavior for unstable and unavailable
      identity, and never treat identifier equality as content equality
- [x] Verify that a changed validation token for the same identifier
      regenerates instead of hitting the old entry
- [x] Verify corrupted and incomplete cache recovery on the resolver-backed
      path
- [x] Separate source byte-range caching from generated-USDC caching, with an
      explicit owner for each

The COPC FileFormat reports every generated-cache decision through the typed
`COPC009`-`COPC012` diagnostics while preserving the conservative fallback. The
generated-cache layout separates a generation key from a source identity key, so
a changed validation token is reported as changed rather than as a source never
seen before.

Phase 4 — repository boundary cleanup:

- [x] Relocate `plugins/httpresolver` to the explicitly test-only
      `tests/plugins/httpresolver/` path
- [x] Remove documentation language implying this repository owns a production
      HTTP implementation
- [x] Document the external resolver contract and `usd-http-resolver`
      interoperability guidance as optional runtime composition
- [x] Verify the repository builds and tests with no CMake dependency,
      submodule, vendored HTTP library, or link dependency on a resolver
      implementation

Phase 5 — diagnostics and secrets:

- [x] Add stable diagnostics for identity unavailable, unstable, stable, and
      changed, and for cache reuse disabled, hit, and invalidated.
      `usdgeo::cache::CacheDecision` publishes the seven categories; COPC
      projects them onto `COPC009`-`COPC012`, each message naming its category
- [x] Keep diagnostics free of transport specifics and token contents. Every
      decision message is a fixed constant owned by `usdgeo::cache`, and a unit
      test asserts none of them names a transport
- [x] Verify no credentials, authorization headers, signed URLs, or tokens are
      persisted into manifests or cache descriptors. Both cache-path components
      are 64-bit hashes, and the conversion conformance test asserts that no
      manifest carries the source path or its validation token

Phase 6 — validation and baselines:

- [x] Pass Tier 1 repository-local resolver contract tests as the CI gate
      without any external resolver repository. `kind: workspace` cells
      configure the repository root, where `USDGEO_BUILD_TESTS` defaults to
      `ON`, on every host and both lanes
- [x] Record Tier 2 integration against an external resolver, a local
      reproducible HTTP server, and a COPC fixture, including local/remote
      output equivalence. Recorded against `usd-http-resolver` `v0.4.0` and the
      81 MB Autzen COPC in the
      [resolver read baseline](../reference/RESOLVER_BASELINE.md)
- [x] Record remote hit ratios and `bytes fetched / source size` baselines. A
      metadata open costs 0.001486 of the asset in three requests; a full read
      costs exactly 1.0 in 277 requests. A generated-cache hit ratio for COPC is
      covered by the resolver-backed converter miss-to-hit test for stable
      identity; the external Tier 2 record remains a source-read baseline and
      does not claim a generated-cache ratio

#### Open after `v0.10.0`

- [x] Declare an OST smoke fixture for the `pointcloud-copc` bundle. Its
      component-owned conformance fixture now exercises the L3 `usdcat.read`
      and L4 `python.stage_open` checks alongside the other product bundles.

- [x] Publish generated cache entries for local COPC inputs.
      `usd-pointcloud-convert` accepts `.copc` and `.copc.laz`, uses the shared
      COPC point stream for fixed-grid and adaptive generation, and publishes
      entries compatible with local COPC FileFormat lookup. Resolver-backed
      publication is covered below and requires a stable resolver identity.
- [x] Accept resolver-addressable COPC identifiers in
      `usd-pointcloud-convert`, as described in the
      [resolver-backed source contract](../architecture/RESOLVER_SOURCE.md).
      Stable resolver identities publish and reuse generated entries; unstable
      and unavailable identities convert without cache publication.

#### Research - runtime streaming (no release gate)

- [x] Add an opt-in COPC runtime-streaming probe that takes a requested node
      level, selects deterministic COPC node identities, decodes only those
      point-data ranges, and reports source bytes read without adding runtime
      abstractions to the conversion pipeline
- [ ] Measure host LOD decisions, OpenUSD payload composition, and renderer
      loading behavior; these remain host-dependent research

E57, delimited text, and other point-cloud formats follow these infrastructure
milestones. A public custom USD schema remains deferred until the documented
plain-attribute metadata contract is stable across formats.

## Notes

The sampling contract uses a versioned fixed-stride selection that preserves
source order and applies the same indices to every populated point attribute.
Its algorithm, version, and target count are normalized cache-key inputs.

Argument normalization makes the streaming reader's chunk, point-range, and
tiled payload controls reachable through the plugin layer and the conversion
tool. Bounds and classification filters are normalized at the plugin boundary,
and attribute selection is normalized before authoring; see the
[plugin adapter contract](../architecture/PLUGIN_ADAPTER.md) and the
[file-format argument contract](../architecture/FILE_FORMAT_ARGUMENTS.md).

Compact `lod` profiles author a single non-tiled `usdLod` root through the
shared authoring path for LAS and LAZ. Tiled LAS and LAZ reads now consume
bounded pull-stream chunks, spool points by source-coordinate tile, and author
one payload-backed level per tile. The explicit conversion tool is the
production entry point for long-running generation; static FileFormat tiling
remains available for compatibility, preview, and small inputs. Generated-
corpus bounded-memory measurement, the Shizuoka LAS baseline, and payload
working-set measurements are documented in the [streaming and tiling roadmap](streaming-and-tiling.md).
A broader real-world dataset matrix remains open.

The LAS conformance fixture and FileFormat Plugin integration gate passed
before LAZ integration. The LAZ reader uses the same point-cloud authoring path
and validates chunked decoder output through its own FileFormat Plugin
integration fixture. Documented support is tracked in
[capability matrix](../reference/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md), which is updated in the
same change as any decoder that widens it.
