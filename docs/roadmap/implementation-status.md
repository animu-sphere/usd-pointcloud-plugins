- [x] Create `usdGeoUsd` `UsdGeomPoints` authoring and metadata round-trip
- [x] Add `usdLas` LAS 1.2-1.4 header inspection and uncompressed point decoding
- [x] OpenUSD FileFormat Plugin PoC (LAS discovery and UsdGeomPoints authoring path)
- [x] LAS reader integration and deterministic conformance fixture
- [x] LAS VLR/EVLR inspection and WKT CRS extraction
- [x] Select laz-perf as the initial LAZ codec and define the chunk reader contract
- [x] Add the laz-perf adapter behind the `usdLaz` chunk reader contract
- [x] Add the LAZ reader conformance fixture and FileFormat Plugin integration
- [ ] Tile / LOD
- [ ] USDC cache

## Next Implementation Sequence

1. Define the shared tile / LOD contracts.

The LAS conformance fixture and FileFormat Plugin integration gate passed before LAZ integration. The LAZ reader now uses the same point-cloud authoring path and validates chunked decoder output through a FileFormat Plugin integration fixture.
